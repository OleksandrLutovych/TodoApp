# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) TS template.

# A quick start Redux + TypeScript Create React App template

An opinionated quick start [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) (CRA) _template_ with configured **Redux**, **TypeScript**, **React Router**, **Enzyme** and custom **ESlint** configuration.

Original Create React App README available [here](./README_CRA.md)

## Usage

```bash
npx create-react-app your-project-name --template typescript-redux
```

Or

```bash
yarn create react-app your-project-name --template typescript-redux
```

`npx` command installs the most recent stable version of CRA from npm.

`--template` parameter points to this template, note that `cra-template-` prefix is omitted.

## Motivation

You know the pain. You start a new project from scratch and need to configure it again and again. It needs routing, ok you setup Router, then you need Redux - ok, oh ðŸ˜© Redux boilerplate is taking so much time to type. Wait... what if you could have all the tools you want just from the beginning? I want to focus on building amazing projects and not spending hours configuring. That's why I've created this template. It's here for you to use.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

<<<<<<< HEAD
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

To learn React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).
=======
- `yarn start` - runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

- `yarn test` - launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

- `yarn build` - builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

- `yarn eject` - exposes content of `react-script` package

- `yarn lint` - lints project files according to eslint rules, see below. Typical use case: continuous integration environments, Travis, CircleCI, etc.

- `yarn fix` - same as `yarn lint`, but also fixes errors, when possible. Typical use case: local development environment, git hooks.

Due to CRA template limitations (we can change only `scripts` and `dependencies` inside generated `package.json`) all configuration is done by adding config files where possible. Also no `devDependencies` for now, sorry.

## Redux configuration

The template provides basic Redux configuration with [feature based](https://redux.js.org/style-guide/style-guide/#structure-files-as-feature-folders-or-ducks) folder structure. You can use [Redux devtools browser extension](http://extension.remotedev.io/). Sample feature included in `src/features` folder, note technology agnostic `features` folder name. Based on Redux maintainers recommendation.

## Testing

Testing is done with [Enzyme](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/).

## [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)

I added `prettier` to force consistent formatting. Don't like trailing semicolons? Feel free to [tweak prettier rules](https://prettier.io/docs/en/configuration.html) inside `.prettierrc` file to match your code style.

## Styles/CSS/Styling

Just for the styling purpose of the example app, I used [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/). The template is shipped with the Materialize by default. I want to make sure that this template is style agnostic so you can plugin any CSS-in-JS or whatever library/framework you want to use for styles on your own.

### How to remove materialize

In order to remove Materialize [MaterializeCSS](https://materializecss.com/) navigate to the `public` folder, open `index.html` and remove following CDN link in the `<head>` lines 18-22:

```html
<!--Import materialize.css-->
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/materialize/1.0.0/css/materialize.min.css"
/>
```

Remove or adjust all the `classNames` related to the Materialize and feel free to use your own styling.

## Eslint configurations

The template extends CRA ESLint rules with a custom set, tailored for the reasonable and clean development process.

Eslint rules are commented for your convenience feel free to tweak or remove them inside `.eslintrc`. No judgment.

## Testing template locally

To test the output of your template locally run

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app --template file:/\path\to\file
```
